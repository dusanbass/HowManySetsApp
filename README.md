# HowManySetsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.

I've made this app for anyone who is critically overwhelmed by the feature rich apps. 

# How To
You name your exercise in the exercise name input. You will find it with the placeholder.
Then you input number of reps you plan to do.
And then you repeat your exercise. That's it.

Also, after each "done" it will ask you if you did correct number of reps.
If yes good, if no, then please setup the number of them to do.
It will not save if you do 0 or 100 more than stated. It's about hitting that target, again, and again.

# TODO: 
After successfully _done_ set, then you enter number of reps, and it hides it,
and makes new field to input new one.
